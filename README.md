# nextmeeting - Show your calendar next meeting in your waybar or polybar

## What is it?

nextmeeting is a simple CLI leveraging gcalcli to show the next meetings.

It has a few features compared to just gcalcli :

- bar integration (i.e: [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)/[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) and probably others)
- smart date in English (not just the date, tomorrow or others)
- show the time to go for current meeting
- change colors if there is 5 minutes to go to the meeting
- hyperlink in default view to click on terminal
- notification via notify-send 5 minutes before meeting
- title ellipsis
- Exclude next day meetings.

## Installation

Use `pip` with:

`pip install -U nextmeeting`

or Checkout the source of this repo by [using uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

`uv run nextmeeting`

If you don't want to use `uv` you can install the dependences packages from PyPi
or from your operating system package manager if available:

- <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/>
- <https://pypi.org/project/gcalcli/>

And the you can run the nextmeeting script:

`python3 ./nextmeeting/cli.py`

alternatively you can even just copy the `./nextmeeting/cli.py` script to your path and run
it to make it more convenient.

## How to use it?

You need to install [gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli) and [setup
the google Oauth integration](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli?tab=readme-ov-file#initial-setup) with google calendar.

By default you can start `nextmeeting` and it will show the list of meetings you
have with "human date".

If you don't see any meetings you may need to specify the target calendar, use
the `--calendar=CALENDAR` flag for that

There is a few options to customize things, see `nextmeeting --help` for more options.

### Waybar

A more interesting use of `nextmeeting` is the integration with waybar, to output nicely on your desktop,
for example my configuration look like this:

```json
    "custom/agenda": {
        "format": "{}",
        "exec": "nextmeeting --max-title-length 30 --waybar",
        "on-click": "nextmeeting --open-meet-url",
        "on-click-right": "kitty -- /bin/bash -c \"batz;echo;cal -3;echo;nextmeeting;read;\";",
        "interval": 59,
        "return-type": "json",
        "tooltip": "true"
    },
```

This will show how long i have until the next meeting. If I click on the item
it will open the meet URL attached to the event. If I hit via a right click it will launch a
`kitty` terminal to show the time zones with
[batz](https://github.com/chmouel/batzconverter) and my next meeting. I can
click on the title in the terminal and it will open the meet URL.

#### Styling

You can style some of the waybar item with the following CSS:

```css
#custom-agenda {
  color: #696969;
}
```

If you enable the option "--notify-min-before-events it will output a class
`soon` if the events is coming soon, you can style it with:

```css
#custom-agenda.soon {
  color: #eb4d4b;
}
```
