# nextmeeting: Calendar Widget for Waybar and Polybar

## Overview

nextmeeting is a simple CLI tool that leverages `gcalcli` to display your
upcoming meetings in bars, terminals, and other scripts.

It goes beyond basic `gcalcli` output:

- Integrates with status bars like [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) and [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar).
- Displays dates in natural English ("tomorrow", "next Monday") instead of raw timestamps.
- Shows time-to-meeting countdowns and changes color when events are imminent.
- Provides clickable hyperlinks in the default terminal view.
- Sends configurable notifications via `notify-send`.
- Truncates long meeting titles for tighter layouts.
- Excludes next-day events when you only care about today.
- Queries CalDAV-compatible calendars with the `--caldav-*` flags.

## Installation

Use `pip` with:

`pip install -U nextmeeting`

Alternatively, if you prefer to run from source, you can use `uv` (recommended)
or install dependencies manually.

### Using uv (recommended)

First, install `uv` by following the instructions [uv installation
guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Then, clone
this repository and run:

```shell
uv run nextmeeting
```

### Manual Installation

If you don't want to use `uv`, install the dependencies manually from PyPI or
your operating system's package manager:

- [python-dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/)
- [gcalcli](https://pypi.org/project/gcalcli/)
- [caldav](https://pypi.org/project/caldav/) *(required when you use the
  `--caldav-*` options)*

Then install nextmeeting itself:

```shell
pip install nextmeeting
```

After installing dependencies, you can run the `nextmeeting` script directly:

```shell
python3 src/nextmeeting/cli.py
```

You can also copy `src/nextmeeting/cli.py` to your system's PATH for convenience.

### [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nextmeeting)

```shell
yay -S nextmeeting
```

### NixOS

For Nix users, the repository includes ready-to-use flake inputs and a
Home-Manager module. Expand below for details.

<details><summary>Flake and Home-Manager install instructions.</summary>

- Add nextmeeting to your flake.

```nix
nextmeeting = {
  url = "github:chmouel/nextmeeting?dir=packaging";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

- Use Home-manager to add nextmeeting to waybar like this:

```nix
let 
  nextmeeting = lib.getExe inputs.nextmeeting.packages.${pkgs.system}.default;
in
{
  "custom/agenda" = {
      format = "{}";
      exec = nextmeeting + "--max-title-length 30 --waybar";
      on-click = nextmeeting + "--open-meet-url";
      interval = 59;
      return-type = "json";
      tooltip = true;
  };
}
```

- Follow along with the rest of the instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Install [gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli).
- [Set up the Google OAuth integration](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli?tab=readme-ov-file#initial-setup)
  so gcalcli can read your calendar.

## Quick Start

Run `uv sync` once, then display upcoming meetings:

```shell
uv run nextmeeting
```

If no meetings show up, specify a calendar with `--calendar=CALENDAR`. Explore
`nextmeeting --help` for every option.

### Working with other calendar servers

Point nextmeeting straight at a CalDAV-compatible server when you do not want
to rely on `gcalcli`:

```shell
nextmeeting \
  --caldav-url https://example.com/dav/calendars/user/work/ \
  --caldav-username user \
  --caldav-password secret
```

Every filter and output mode still applies. If your server exposes several
collections, pass `--caldav-calendar` with the specific collection URL. For
basic-auth deployments the username and password flags are enough; for token
auth just put the token in `--caldav-password`.

The fetch window defaults to ‚Äú12 hours back, 48 hours ahead‚Äù. Tune it with:

- `--caldav-lookbehind-hours` to include ongoing meetings that started up to N
  hours ago (default `12`).
- `--caldav-lookahead-hours` to look N hours into the future (default `48`).

To avoid typing the flags each time, drop them in your config file:

```toml
[nextmeeting]
caldav-url = "https://example.com/dav/calendars/user/work/"
caldav-username = "user"
caldav-password = "secret"
today-only = true
```

If a request fails, rerun with `-v` (or `--debug`) to see the full traceback and
the endpoints that were attempted.

### JSON output

If you need machine-readable output outside Waybar, use `--json` to print the
same JSON shape as `--waybar` (keys like `text`, `tooltip`, and optional
`class`). This is useful for other bars or scripts:

```shell
nextmeeting --json
```

### Configuration file

You can set defaults in a TOML file. By default, `~/.config/nextmeeting/config.toml`
is loaded if present, or you can point to a custom file with `--config`.

Command-line flags map directly to keys in the `[nextmeeting]` table: remove the
leading `--` and keep hyphen separators (`--max-title-length` ‚Üí `max-title-length`).

Example `~/.config/nextmeeting/config.toml`:

```toml
[nextmeeting]
calendar = "Work"
max-title-length = 30
today-only = true
include-title = ["standup", "1:1"]
exclude-title = ["OOO"]
notify-min-before-events = 5
notify-offsets = [15, 5]
privacy = false
```

CLI flags always override config values.

### Event caching

Reduce calls to `gcalcli` by caching its raw output for a short period:

```shell
nextmeeting --cache-events-ttl 2   # cache for 2 minutes
```

### Polybar output

For Polybar, print a single-line text with the next meeting:

```shell
nextmeeting --polybar
```

It uses the same formatting and filters as other modes and respects
`--max-title-length`.

### Custom formatting

You can customize how each line is rendered using templates. Available
placeholders: `{when}`, `{title}`, `{start_time}`, `{end_time}`, `{meet_url}`,
`{calendar_url}`, `{minutes_until}`, `{is_all_day}`, `{is_ongoing}`.

```shell
# Single-line formatting (TTY, Polybar, and Waybar text)
nextmeeting --format "{when} ‚Ä¢ {title}"

# Waybar tooltip formatting (applies to the tooltip only)
nextmeeting --waybar --tooltip-format "{start_time:%H:%M}-{end_time:%H:%M} ¬∑ {title}"
```

Use 12-hour timestamps for absolute times:

```shell
nextmeeting --time-format 12h
```

### Showing multiple items

Limit the number of meetings shown in list-style outputs (TTY and Waybar
tooltip):

```shell
nextmeeting --limit 3
```

### Title filters

You can include or exclude meetings based on title substrings (case-insensitive):

```shell
# Only include meetings containing either "standup" or "1:1"
nextmeeting --include-title standup --include-title "1:1"

# Exclude meetings containing "OOO" or "holiday"
nextmeeting --exclude-title ooo --exclude-title holiday
```

Filters apply across modes (TTY, `--json`, `--waybar`).

You can also restrict to working hours by start time:

```shell
nextmeeting --work-hours 09:00-18:00
```

Filter by calendar using substrings of the event URL (useful when you have
multiple accounts/calendars):

```shell
nextmeeting --include-calendar "primary" --exclude-calendar "personal"
```

### Privacy mode

Redact meeting titles to a static label to avoid leaking details:

```shell
nextmeeting --privacy               # titles become "Busy"
nextmeeting --privacy --privacy-title "Busy üóìÔ∏è"
```

Unicode titles like the emoji example work fine, but sticking to ASCII keeps the
output consistent across limited fonts.

### Quick actions

- Open the next meeting URL

  ```shell
  nextmeeting --open-meet-url
  ```

- Copy the next meeting URL to the clipboard (tries `wl-copy`, `xclip`, or `pbcopy`; falls back to printing)

  ```shell
  nextmeeting --copy-meeting-url
  ```

- Open the Google Calendar day view for the next meeting (respects `--google-domain` if set)

  ```shell
  nextmeeting --open-calendar-day
  ```

### Waybar

A more interesting use case for `nextmeeting` is its integration with Waybar,
allowing for a clean output on your desktop. For example, my configuration
looks like this:

```json
    "custom/agenda": {
        "format": "{}",
        "exec": "nextmeeting --max-title-length 30 --waybar",
        "on-click": "nextmeeting --open-meet-url",
        "on-click-right": "kitty -- /bin/bash -c \"batz;echo;cal -3;echo;nextmeeting;read;\"",
        "interval": 59,
        "return-type": "json",
        "tooltip": "true"
    },
```

This configuration displays the time remaining until my next meeting. Clicking
the item opens the meeting's URL. A right-click launches a `kitty` terminal to
show time zones using [batz](https://github.com/chmouel/batzconverter) and my
next meeting. I can also click on the meeting title within the terminal to open
its URL.

#### Styling

You can style the Waybar item using the following CSS:

```css
#custom-agenda {
  color: #696969;
}
```

If you enable the `--notify-min-before-events` option, `nextmeeting` will
output a `soon` class when an event is approaching, allowing you to style it
with:

```css
#custom-agenda.soon {
  color: #eb4d4b;
}
```

### Notifications

- Choose how many minutes before a meeting to trigger the built-in notification
  and the `soon` CSS class with `--notify-min-before-events` (default `5`).
- Add extra reminder offsets with `--notify-offsets` (repeatable or comma separated):

  ```shell
  nextmeeting --notify-offsets 15 --notify-offsets 5   # 15 and 5 minutes
  nextmeeting --notify-offsets 20,10,5                 # CSV variant
  ```

- Customize the highlighted countdown in Waybar with `--notify-min-color` and
  `--notify-min-color-foreground`.
- Control notification urgency with `--notify-urgency low|normal|critical`.
- Snooze all notifications and exit:

  ```shell
  nextmeeting --snooze 30    # minutes
  ```

- Send a once-per-day morning agenda near a specific time (¬±2 minutes window):

  ```shell
  nextmeeting --morning-agenda 09:00
  ```
